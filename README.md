## Client Segmentation for Financial Institutions

**Specializing in the Distribution of Structured Investment Products Using RFM and K-Means Clustering Model**

---

This report outlines a conceptual project design for implementing the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) client segmentation model, enhanced with K-Means clustering, within financial institutions that specialize in the distribution of structured investment products. 

The methodology described in this paper aims to provide a cost-effective and efficient data-driven approach for analyzing the companyâ€™s customer base. By segmenting clients based on their transaction history, investment banks can:

- Identify key customer groups
- Target clients at risk of attrition
- Optimize the allocation of resources for marketing and sales efforts

The application of the K-Means clustering algorithm on top of the classical RFM client segmentation model allows for more refined client segmentation, better tailored to the specific characteristics of the analyzed customer base.
